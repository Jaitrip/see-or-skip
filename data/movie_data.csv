IN WHICH SCHOOL WOULD YOU PLACE YOUR CHILD Imagine that you move to a new city with your family  The city has only two schools so you decide to pay a visit to each of them to decide which one to enroll your child in At the first school he visits the school principal explains to him that there the child studies throughout the year and at the end of the year he will take an assessment test  If approved it will go to the next year to a special class with all the students who have dedicated themselves forming an elite class  If the school fails the school will keep the child locked in a room forever with all those who have failed  Nor will parents ever see their children again  THEY WILL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE At the second school you visit you find that the system is different  At the end of the year the approved children will also go to a more advanced class but those who fail will repeat the year having to undergo again the teachings and tests in which they failed AS MANY TIMES AS NECESSARY until they are approved thinkingfaceNow I would like you to answer SINCERELY In which school would you enroll your child  foldedhands,1

At 019 you can hear jack sing part of ill be there next time but since they did not use really any of the lyrics apparently they see that as not having to credit ajr,1

Did they cut Ajr out of the real movies Ost,1
Coco  the orther side Soul  the up side,1
Omg they used the ajr overture,1
The cowboy dance was the unfunniest joke i have ever seen,0
Now I have to imagineer how Inside Out ties into this,1
OMG AJR,1
The music is this trailer appears to be too interesting and irresistible,2
Its sad that mo one saw or help Joe when he fell,1
Ahhh AJRs overture,1
Everyone that IMMEDIATELY takes a trailer as a movie This sucks it looks like Inside Out ripoffYea Pixar loves to screw with peoples visual expectations so congratulations for allowing ONE trailer of no more than small snippets of nonessential scenes to tell you the whole story in 1 minute and 30 seconds Mustve been a BAD movie to feature little to nothing but a silly booger dancing a cowboy jig,0
I like the song,2
AJR,1
Anyone else freak out with AJR OVERTURE,1
Anyone else freak out with AJR OVERTURE,1

Dont waste your time on movie trailers and movies get out and do something,0
I adore AJR and I dont want to fuel a fire but I find it kind of ironic and a bit sad that Jon Bellion wanted to write music for Pixar and a group that a part of Jons fandom is skeptic about see HumanNetflix Trip drama All Time LowBurn the House Down drama sample machine drama etc and one that people say he wrote about see Lets Begin lyrics is in a Pixar trailer lol,1
Im pretty sure that scooter just drove over the manhole,1
RIP JoeLast words Whoa Whoa Sorry,1
In Pete Docter we trust ,1
why didnt the biker fell down the sewer i mean he was right on it before joe,1
This looks like another phenomenal Pixar classicUntil 053,2
Pixar  never ceases to amaze Great job,2
As soon as I heard AJR glad theyre finally getting some of the recognition that they deserve within the first few seconds of the trailer I knew I needed to see this movie even though I know its going to make me cry,2
Ok this movie could have been a really great movie with some great social commentary and life and following your dreams but then he turns in to a blue booger and that just makes me mad but Im still going to watch it because its Pixar,2
Waitif he almost got hit by the motorcycle then how did he fall in the hole if both the hole and motorcycle were there 046,1
Long way from Snow White,1
The first few seconds of the video YOU VERY INSPIRING when you see the main character di Me,1
We sure this isnt the Inception sequel,1
ey,1
Why is the hole to the sewers wide open in the middle of the road Theres not even caution tape or cones around it,1
The soul girl is going to go into the body with him itll be a split personality Just my theory,1
Is it touch And why the heck Joe feel the momentum,1
He die,1
rip my cinemas r closed ,1
Is all this living really worth dying for Honestly thats a scary thing to think about eternal life without happiness or death with happiness,1
This is somehow giving me Aurther vibes from the game Dreams XD,1
Ya great movie to show kids like me about dying AND SAYING IT MUST HAVE BEEN SUDDEN FOR YOU,1
imagine this really big plot twistthat the girl soul was the girl that was in his class that was presenting on a trumpet ,1
Im sure the scene in the movie where his soul and the other one goes in the same body and they got like one take the control of the body while the other sleep Or they talk simultaneously Or they are mix together,1
IS THAT THE SAILSCLERK FROM NEO YOKIO,1
His mouth werent moving when he said ok I get it,1
Too bad the Coronavirus closed cinemas,0
first pixar movie to have the main character get fuckin murdered onscreen,1
Yeah no just 187k view in 2 week  they will not resume the production of soul,1
How to die fall into the sewer even though its probably 5 feet deep,1
WHAT THEY CANT EAT what a hard world,1
I feel like his death was treated too much as a joke,1
109 Can someone please tell me whos this voice actor His voice sounds so familiar,1
sadbutrelievedfaceanxiousfacewithsweatanxiousfacewithsweat,1
I feel like why would God have a way for a full professed person have a way to the great before what,1
Super,2
When you die because Corona virus,1
Is that the gunga ginga person singing in the background,1
This movie is like one from the disneys,1
044 when it is time to hand in tests,1
Big smoke finally lost some weight,1
When you die in Mexico Coco  you live in another world until you are forgotten When you die in America this happens Why I am feeling that the Karens from Facebook will try to shut down the movie because of their vision of the afterlife,1
Dude are u saying that i have eye problems in death and in life,1
The counts off Huh,1
Dont know why they just dont call it heaven in the film instead of the great beyond trying to stay away from the religious stuff huh not good,1
This made the movie really dark,1
Why couldnt the part where hes actually alive be a plot twist in the movie Why show it now,1
They literally just advertised the whole movie,1
Me OK OK movie seems niceHeard word QUIRK me hold up,1
I want to see soul,2
Is living worth dying for Ooooohhexplodinghead really hard to answer,1
I keep watching this its my 5th time,1
if dis delayed,1
I want to make a joke buts its about a certain pandemic,1
oh well im ready to cry the shit outta myself,1

I wonder whats with the choir singing,1
Was that Richard Ayoade Sending souls to earth,1
Perfect cartoon,1
Did anyone heard the OOF   from the beginning,1
To be honest with you this actually looks like a pretty good movie,2
What the hell is that Pixars movie gotten weird Theres no way my soul will be like that after died,1
THIS LOOKS GOOD,2
pretty sure this trailer just showd us the entire movie,1
A much more interesting trailer than the first one,2
Prepare yourself for an onion ninjas massive attack,1
Those 48 dislikers should have never been born,1

Shang Tsung favorite movie,1
What is song named,1
They Princess  The Frog this movie,1
I better start stocking up on tissues cuz this is going to be yet another blubberfest,1
I like the idea of it but hopefully it will be better than Inside Out,2
Hey guys what movie idea you guys got Death related Awsome make that a movie,2
I knew it,1
Yesss this looks so trippy Cant wait to watch this on psychedelics lmao,1
A Soul for a Soul This does put a smile on my face,1
Ok but when this movie comes out there will most likely be a lockdown for the coranavirus,1
blueheartblueheartblueheart,1
Hmmmm Finally an original ish idea from Disney,2
I hear onions voice form apple  onion,1
Another soulful movie by Disney and PixarI cant wait to see this one,2
from the makers of inside out coco Im pretty sure this will make me cryagain,2
Bruh the only reason Im seeing this is Daveed Diggs,1
when kids see this movie they will be more confused about the afterlife,1
i see mortals are getting closer to the great truth,1
This reminds me so much of the story mode for the ps4 exclusive dreams Ironic right Lol,1
I have a theoryBefore Joe taught music in New York he came from a school in San Francisco where a young student with five emotions just recently moved in,1
Alright this looks amazing,2
Nothing like having the whole movie spoiled by a trailer,0
This is so sad He cant taste or smell pizza,1
I think that soul girl will be his daughter Im just guessing,1
Interesting trailer,2
number 1 rule of animation movieif your main character is black then have them for the majority of the film as other thing,1
Thats not how soul works After death the Soul enters after life and immediately shifts into another body that is when baby is born It all happens in a second,1
Although better than the first trailer but I still think they should have focused more on the real life story or just specificity be about that,1
Please No more trailers This movie looks awesome,2
Oof,1
Based on Inside Out Pixar going deep is a cause for celebration This could be stunning,2
Amazing,2
I like the second trailer for Soul and it is alright,2
As a person puts on new garments giving up old ones the soul similarly accepts new material bodies giving up the old and useless ones,1
Guys I just watched soul for free,1
Story looks nice animation is a bit bad,1
Who else saw the ad trailer before the trailer,1
Did they spoil the movie I can not stand trailers that give us the entire plot we didnt need to know he was still alive expressionlessfaceexpressionlessfaceexpressionlessface,1
Ironic because black people dont have souls m,1
Yep dont waste your time on what makes moneygo do something productive Let others PAY to hear your music PAY to buy your art and PAY to watch your movieswho has to eat anyway It is overrated,1
046 is that max,1
I would much prefer a movie about this guy fully in the real world but you never know it might be really good,2
Lets just say That the main character does not look like a soul its more like a squid Oh thats a hatSHET,1
So Disney and Pixar finally decided to make a black person the lead of a movie but they ended up killing him can you believe that Unbelievable,1
Man itll have been really good if not for that blue thing,1
Not try ing to be racist,1
Disny 2020 what if black people had fleeings,1
The song in the back round is come hang out,1
I hope theres a Toy Story Easter egg in this,1
The fact that this is coming this year makes me whole,1
It doesnt look bad but I dont think it looks nearly as good as Onward,1
looks like a short but its gonna be ana mazing film,2
Jamie Foxx first voice over film  I have to see this,1
If you now ajr like this comment because the ajr song come hang out plays,1
I kinda wish they played Overture longer,1
From the creators of Inside Out and COCO means that  there wont be any sequel to this movie,1

A nonbiblical type of soul which literally is pagan concept An energy type that barely have image but is totally different from its body not having a nose neither ears nor hair Just making some figure variances for distinction  But it certainly has No real GOD nor angels just the wandering and the damned souls A pagan view of spirituality especifically norse type of spirituality a puny speck of talkingenergy figure The norwegian pagan cult promotes that souls are speck fragments of energy or gloomy ball or cluster of luminal speck or light,1
When does this come out it looks so goodsmilingfacewith3heartssmilingfacewith3hearts,2

Im looking forward to this one,2
No worriescoronavirus will help you with the count,1

Yes Can you do please Elf 2 Buddy Saves Christmas  Will Ferrell  Trailer,1
Why do these little characters look like Sour Gummy Worms I just wanna bite off of themfacesavoringfood,1
Someone at Pixar wants to die,0
Before watching the full trailer I actually thought it was a sort of inside out sequel,1
I cant wait I want to see it,2
Super simple way to explain what its like to be trans to children and teens Some days too Wrong body matched to soul,1
i just saw a LSD trip,1
Joes mama must be a great musician,1
Jewish women LOVE BBC,1
Oh good another Pixar movie to make me cry until Im almost sick,1
I am already crying I think it will be perfect Or I really hope so,1
110 WHOS THE VOICE ,1
I cant wait to see this movie in theaters,2
Its beautiful,2
Probably the animation for ghosts was inside outs idea and the animation and smiles were form coco,1
109 Who else heard Onion from Apple and Onion,1
131 but you can hear and see,1
137 wow put some effort atleast,1
ERMAC The Movie,1
110 I dont wanna go to EarthRelatable,1
Reminds me of Delivering Milo,1
Whos joeJOE MAMA,1
I presume 22 wants no involvement on going to Earth because she probably did something in life that was shameful and was humiliated as a result,1
Im ready to cry,1
Disney Pixar soul is a prequel to inside out,1
Its weird that a multi billion dollar company released a trailer for a movie about souls and heaven and hell and reincarnation while a lot of people will die in a short space of time I guess it will help kids cope when there parents pass on,1
109 is that the voice of Onion in Apple  Onion,1
Just wanted to be the 700th person to commentsmilingfacewithsunglasses,1
This is so beautiful The concepts the animations music the warmth I love they make this stuff for kids Death should not be this dreadful experience I wish I watched a movie like this when I was a kid I was always so scared Plus almost every near death experience testimony is so similar to this representation Lovely,2
Looks amazing I miss Pixar It is an incredible experience there I like the reactions in the comments ,2
Now this looks likea real pixar moviegrinningsquintingface,2
Listen I see Tina Fey I watch  good or bad Its freaking TINA FEY,1
Love ittwohearts,2
Feel like I watched the whole movie lol,1
This will be a good movie I wish it creates some sense of consciousness about life in everyones mind grinningfacewithsmilingeyes,2
Inside out was such a great movie I cant wait for this to come out thumbsupmediumdarkskintone,2
Well this brings up several philosophical questions,1
This remindes me of Inside Out,1
Pixars graphic has become so realistic that its actually scary,2
This looks too familiar,2
Coronavirus says to delay it,1
The great beyond is nice Lots of green and blue,1
Pixars remake of End of Evangelion looks great,1
Wait is Pixar making an Isekai,1
This cartoon allows us to imagine the other worldwhich we sometimes want to see,1
Yeah I saw that in the street it was a deep hole not covered and I thought how suicidal am I right now To just pretend its not there and just falland then theres this movie facewithtearsofjoy death on hold facewithtearsofjoy,1
I can literally tell Im going to cry so hazard when watching this loudlycryingfaceloudlycryingfaceloudlycryingface,2
This looks absolutely great,2
Pixar lets make a movie about death The crew YES thats what we wanted,2
109 Mr Pickles,1
110 Whos voice is that,1
Kids after watching thisDying is funAdultsgrinningfacewithsweatfacewithoutmouth,1
Everyone see  soul Me  big smoke,1
A movie I can somewhat correlate with,2
Next Pixar moviesCutleries Frying PansLiving roomsHouses story of four houses next to each otherRoadsBicycles MotorcyclesCars wait its done alreadyPlanes wait this one tooCranes this hasnt Graves oh thats an amazing concept A story to dozen of graves next to each otherParksThings in a parkApartmentsMoviesGamesJesus thats Pixar,1
he about to wake up with a nice paycheck from the city,1
What if cara have feelingswhat if planes have feelingswhat if emotions have feelingswhat if soul have feelings,1
I was thinking what is this inside out And then it says from the makers of inside out so I then I was like ah ok,1
Initially I thought it was titled Soul Train and I got pretty excited Now Im disappointed AND pissed off theres a Disney movie attempting to teach death to the kids Of course its a lot better than any other premise theyve come up with in decades,0
THIS REMINDS ME OF INSIDEOUT ALOTTTT,1
Hey my name is Riley I like hockey and I just moved to San Francisco,1
Looking at this from just a purely visual perspective this movie looks like it will be amazing However I will admit that with all these super realistic visually rendered movies Im kind of disappointed with how they always go with such exaggerated character designs I mean like I know theyre probably trying to maintain somewhat of a unique aesthetic however I do think it would be cool to see something like this with more accurate porportions Not holding this against the movie in anyway still a great looking film overall,2
Secret sequel to Inside Out,1
I cant wait to do LSD and go watch this movie Like a responsible adult,1
a pixar movie about jazz Im so down,2
Another Coco movie Geez,1
The trailer looks great This will either be a hit or miss movie,2
What is the song that starts when the protag starts to fall down,1
Regular show already did this,1
I was skeptical at first but this trailer gave me more hope for the film,2
Funny how this movie is coming out Right when Covid19 is a big thing,1
So it looks like Pixar has embraced the Mormon lie of preexistance This is a very unbiblical teaching of human souls existing in heaven before being born on earth The Bible tells a much different story Psalm 1391316 NKJVFor You formed my inward parts You covered me in my mothers womb 14 I will praise You for I am fearfully and wonderfully made Marvelous are Your works And that my soul knows very well 15 My frame was not hidden from You When I was made in secret And skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth 16 Your eyes saw my substance being yet unformed And in Your book they all were written The days fashioned for me When as yet there were none of them,1
No hell,0
God worshippers rejoice,1
Winner Oscars 2021 Animated Film SOUL,1

This movie will be awesome Like most Pixars movies  I cant wait ,2
How am I just now finding out about this,1
AJR,1
Did they make a black version of the first few episodes of Yu Yu Hakusho,1
Did you know that the music was made by the AJR Brothers Only me Ok ,1
Im so happy Disney used an AJR songStill upset they didnt credit though,1
AJR,1
Did anyone else notice the Just keep swimming sticker at 027  D,1
It looked super cool and original until a minute in when it basically said this is gonna be another Inside Out,2
Whos here for the AJR song,1
Cant believe they used ajrs music this is awesome,2
Honestly i would have never heard about this if it wasnt for ajr,1
The music in the beginning is from AJRs Overture  amazing band  check them out ,1
Garbage bin movie,0
Eagerly waiting,2
That Guy Looks Like Jamie Foxx,1
Im seeing a lot of people complaining about the character turning into an inside out type of character I myself am one of those people I am a little disappointed that it couldnt be just about a struggling artist HOWEVER I do have faith in this film and from what I can see it seems like this will be in a way targeted more towards an older demographic of course there will be jokes that will appeal to a younger audience and really explore the ideas of our place in the universe and what we are willing to do to achieve our dreams I have a lot of faith in Pixar that this will be a more serious film and going into places that they usually dont explore And I guess the characters turn similar to Inside Out characters so that Pixar could explore the deeper meanings about our dreams of what we want to be without losing the interest of a younger demographicEdit I also just realized that not only the film is about the main characters soul so the films name is Soul but hes also a jazz musician which then makes the movies name relate to soul jazz,0
Looking forward to be emotionally gutwrenched by Pixar,2
I love AJR so much ,2
The blob 2020 version,1

Havent scrolled through all the comments at the time of this post21k but who is only watching this because if there use of overture from ajr,1

2 best pixar movies in my opinion UP and Inside out Both made by Pete docter I have unreal expectations from that movie,1
Trailer what do you want to be remembered for Disney making a colored person a main character and then making him die,1

So this is gonna go one of 2 waysVersion 1 they pull an emoji movie where the ultimate goal is to get back to his body while running away from tons of soul officersVersion 2 they find his body halfway through the movie but struggle It turns into inside out with them fighting for controlVersion 3 they create a creative and refreshing movie which weve never seen the likes of before Who am I kidding that isnt gonna happen,1

I am excited to see it It does have a lot of lovely designs I cant say anything on the story yet until I watch it I like how earth looks so charming The spirit guides being 2D animated is a nice touch you really get a sense that theyre from a different dimension But my only complaint is the actually souls of the people Theyre so bland looking I can understand if the souls of the new people coming into the world are a bit bland because they havent developed their personalities yet but for some middle aged dude whose a musician and is an optimist and who has a personality dont you wanna add a bit more to his soul form other than just giving him a cute little hatI get that they dont want them to be too distinct that it looks like a mess of different characters They want certain traits to remain consistent so we get that they are souls but I dont know it just doesnt look right to me Maybe itll grow on me when I watch it,2
